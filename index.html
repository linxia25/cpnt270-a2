  <h1>How to buy furniture in Canada?</h1>
  <p><strong>If you want to understand a person, it is better to look at the furnishings in her home than by looking at what clothes she is wearing.</strong></p>
  <p>Why in Canada, people always donâ€™t know where to buy good-quality and high-value furniture?</p>
  <p>Compared with most countries in the world, Canada is simply a paradise for furniture!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local furniture industry in Canada is very developed. Many Made in Canada furniture brands have a long history, high quality and they are very popular.</li>
      <li>Many major furniture brands in the United States are optimistic about the Canadian market, and one after another comes to Canada to open stores.</li>
      <li>In addition, over the years, even the old and luxury furniture companies in Europe have come here one after another, all opening their doors in the prosperous areas of Canadian cities.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>In order to solve the big bug "I don't know where to buy furniture in Canada" for everyone, Evan decided to dedicate his years of experience to everyone. </p>
  <p>We hope everyone can make their home their dream home without hurting their wallets.</p>

    <h2>Structube</h2>
      <p>Structube is a Canadian family-owned company, and now has more than 50 branches across Canada, with a low price as its highlight!</p>
      <p>The reason why Structube is the <strong>"H&M" </strong>in furniture stores is that many of its styles and models are made by referring to and imitating big-name and luxury furniture.</p>
      <p>The style is modern, the quality is good, and the price is similar to IKEA.</p>

      </ul>
    
    <h2>HomeSense</h2>
    <p>HomeSense is a brand of TJX company. You can often find some famous brand furniture at HomeSense, but the prices are very cheap.</p>
    <p>If Structube is known for <i>"low cheap"</i>, then HomeSense is known for <i>"off cheap"</i>.</p>
    <p>The specialty of this store is that it usually sells some discounted, off-season big-name furniture at low prices. What's more, the goods that arrive in the store every week are different, and you need to visit frequently.</p>

    <p>After talking about economical furniture, let's take everyone to the world of higher-grade furniture.</p>
    <p>First of all, we recommend EQ3, a local Canadian brand from Winnipeg.</p> 
    <p>This brand takes the simple and modern style that is popular nowadays. EQ3 supports private customization, and its workmanship is good. Leather art and cloth art are its expertise.</p>

    <h2>CB2</h2>
    <p>CB2 is the most cost-effective brand of furniture. CB2's position in the furniture industry is equivalent to Aritzia's position in the fashion industry.</p>
    <p>Its furniture has a strong American style, and everything is designed with care and small ingenuity in it. The sense of design is very strong, and you can't help but look at it.</p>

    <p>If it is online shopping, we only recommend buying small furniture. For large pieces of furniture such as beds, sofas, and dining tables that are often used in daily life, I suggest you go to a physical store and see is believable.</p>
